# Security Policy

Thanks for taking the time to help keep this project secure! 🙏  
Volga is currently in **0.x** and maintained by a small team, so the security
process is intentionally lightweight.

---

## Supported Versions

During the **0.x** stage, we generally **support security fixes only for the
latest released version**.

- ✅ **Supported:** latest `0.x.y`
- ❌ **Not supported:** older `0.x.y` versions (no backports)

In practice, security fixes are published as part of the next release.  
If a fix is important, we may ship a quick patch release - but we typically
won’t maintain intermediate versions once a newer release is available.

---

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you’ve found a security issue, please **do not open a public issue**
right away.

Instead, report it privately:
- Open a **GitHub Security Advisory** (preferred), or
- Contact the maintainer via the repository’s listed contact channels.

Please include:
- A clear description of the issue
- Impact and severity (if known)
- Steps to reproduce / PoC (if available)
- Affected versions and environment details

---

## What to Expect

We aim to:
- acknowledge reports within a reasonable time,
- assess impact and decide on a fix,
- publish a release containing the fix,
- credit the reporter (if desired).

If the issue is already public or actively exploited, we may prioritize a faster
release.

## Coordinated Disclosure

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will work with you on a reasonable
timeline for releasing details once a fix is available.
