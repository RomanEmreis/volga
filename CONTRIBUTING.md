# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! ❤️  
All kinds of contributions are welcome - ideas, bug reports, documentation fixes,
and code improvements.

This project is currently maintained by a small team (often just one person),
so please keep that in mind when interacting or proposing changes.

## Reporting issues

Before opening an issue:
- Please check if a similar issue already exists.
- Include clear steps to reproduce (if applicable).
- For feature requests, describe the problem you’re trying to solve.

If you’re unsure, feel free to open a discussion first.

## Pull Requests

A few simple guidelines:

- All changes should go through a pull request.
- Keep PRs focused and reasonably small.
- Follow existing code style and conventions.
- Add tests where it makes sense.
- Clearly describe *why* the change is needed, not just *what* changed.

Draft PRs are totally fine if you want early feedback.

## Breaking changes

Breaking changes are welcome, but:
- Please open an issue or discussion first.
- Clearly explain the motivation and impact.
- Migration guidance is highly appreciated.

## Communication

Be kind, constructive, and respectful.
By participating in this project, you agree to follow the Code of Conduct.
